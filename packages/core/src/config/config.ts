// The configuration model, redesigned from `pkg/docket/config.go` for the
// Obsidian-native layout. It is a pure, runtime-neutral transform: an adapter
// (the plugin from `data.json` + per-device localStorage, the CLI from its own
// config file + `.env`) parses its own source and hands `buildConfig` a plain
// file-config object plus the injected {@link Secrets}; this module validates,
// resolves, and hard-scope-guards it into a {@link Config}, or throws. It reads
// no files and no environment, so it works identically on both hosts and stays
// mobile-safe.
//
// Every mapped destination resolves to a cleaned POSIX path under the sync root;
// resolution never yields a path outside it (the hard scope guard). Source
// strings (a Confluence page/folder/space link) are opaque here — their format
// is validated by the Confluence client in M6.2. File/`.env`/localStorage reading
// lives in the adapters (M8.2/M10.1).
