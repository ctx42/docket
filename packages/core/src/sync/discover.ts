// Folder and space discovery, ported from the walk halves of
// `pkg/docket/folders.go` and `spaces.go`. A configured folder or space is walked
// recursively to derive a Markdown destination for every descendant page, without
// writing anything — the pull (`./pull.ts`) fetches and stores them. A page that
// cannot be placed (its title derives to an empty name, or its name collides with
// a sibling) is recorded and skipped along with its subtree; sibling pages still
// proceed. Everything goes through the {@link ConfluenceClient} and
// {@link Reporter} ports; paths are POSIX.
