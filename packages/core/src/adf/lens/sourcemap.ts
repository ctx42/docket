// The source map, ported from `pkg/adf/sourcemap.go`, plus the top-level render
// assembly it shares with `MarshallMarkdown`. A render pairs each non-empty
// top-level block with the ADF node that produced it, recording the block's byte
// range in the output — the invisible anchor push uses to back-port edits
// without writing any marker into the Markdown. Offsets are string indices
// (UTF-16 code units), used consistently for both the recorded spans and the
// slices that read them back, so the map stays self-consistent.
//
// Landed ahead of its plan slot (M5.2) because the Put lens (M4) needs
// `baselineBlocks`, which the source map produces.
