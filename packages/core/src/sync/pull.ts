// Pull orchestration, ported from `pkg/docket/pull.go`. A pull fetches each
// managed page's ADF, caches it, renders its Markdown (downloading the page's
// images first so the render can link them), and writes the Markdown to both the
// cache and the note. A batch pull first probes every page's current remote
// version in one bulk request: a page whose version is already in the ADF cache
// renders straight from the cache, skipping the body download, so a re-pull of a
// mostly-unchanged space costs a fraction of the requests. The ADF cache and the per-version `.md` live under the
// injected `cacheDir` (the plugin data dir / CLI work tree, device-local per
// M6.3); images land under `assetsDir` (below the sync root); notes go to their
// dest paths. Everything is driven through the {@link ConfluenceClient},
// {@link FileSystem}, and {@link Reporter} ports. A batch pull fans out over its
// pages with {@link mapPool}, running up to {@link PULL_CONCURRENCY} at once (the
// HTTP client's semaphore still caps sockets), and folds the per-page results
// back in input order so the log and tally stay deterministic. Folder/space
// discovery is in `./discover.ts`; this module is the page pull and the
// `pullConfig`/`pullSelected` entry points.
