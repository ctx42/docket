// desktop-only, so a path the user enters may be an absolute OS path (the CLI's
// `.docket.yaml` can live anywhere on disk) or a vault-relative path. Absolute
// paths go through Node's `fs`; vault-relative paths through Obsidian's vault
// adapter, whose methods only accept normalized vault-relative paths — handing
// them an absolute path makes them look under the vault root and report "not
// found". This is glue (Node + `obsidian`), verified by typecheck + manual load,
// not unit-tested.
