# docket

Edit Atlassian Confluence pages as local Markdown — from your terminal **or**
from inside Obsidian — without ever corrupting the page.

## Overview

Would you rather write in Markdown than fight the Confluence editor? `docket`
pulls a page down as clean Markdown, lets you edit it however you like, and
pushes your edits back — on one promise:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A push either applies exactly what you changed or is safely rejected.
> **It never corrupts the page.**

Confluence stores far more than Markdown can express — panels, macros, table
structure, node ids. `docket` keeps all of it: only the blocks you actually
changed are written back, and anything Markdown can't represent stays
read-only, refused with a message rather than guessed. Sync a single page, a
whole folder, or an entire space, mirrored into a local directory tree that
tracks the remote layout.

The round-trip stays lossless through a *retentive lens*: on pull, `docket`
caches the original Atlassian Document Format (ADF) alongside the Markdown; on
push, it back-ports your changes onto that cache, recovering everything
Markdown can't carry from the original.

`docket` is a ground-up TypeScript rewrite of the author's earlier Go tool of
the same name, which it now supersedes.

## Two ways to use it, one engine

`docket` ships **two front ends over one runtime-neutral core**, so a page
pulled by one round-trips cleanly through the other. Pick whichever fits how
you work — or use both against the same vault.

| Surface             | What it is                                               | Reach for it when…                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI**             | A single self-contained binary (`docket`).               | You script it, run it in CI, or live in the terminal. |
| **Obsidian plugin** | A control-center panel and settings tab inside Obsidian. | You want pull/push on a click, next to your notes.    |

## Features

- **Lossless round-trip.** Only changed blocks are written back; unexpressible
  content is preserved verbatim, never guessed.
- **Clean Markdown out.** Pages render to readable Markdown with images pulled
  into a shared `_assets/` directory and embedded as Obsidian `![[wikilinks]]`.
- **Whole-tree mirroring.** A folder or space — pages and nested sub-folders —
  maps to a local directory tree; names derive from page titles.
- **Rich formatting survives.** Panels, tables, mentions, status/date/emoji,
  colored and underlined text, and macros all round-trip.
- **Comments (opt-in).** Inline and footer comments pull in as `[!comment]`
  callouts with `[^cf-…]` anchors; a push preserves them, and resolves an
  inline comment whose callout and anchor you removed. Off by default.
- **Safe concurrent edits.** A three-way merge folds in non-overlapping remote
  changes; a genuine conflict is refused, not clobbered.
- **Cross-page links** rewrite to local `.md` paths on pull and restore on push.
- **Create pages** from a local note; they inherit the parent's permissions.
- **Housekeeping:** garbage-collect unreferenced assets and prune local files
  deleted upstream.

## Packages

`docket` is a [Bun](https://bun.sh) workspace of three packages:

| Package                                               | What it is                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`@docket/core`](packages/core)                       | Runtime-neutral core: the ADF↔Markdown lens, sync orchestration, and injected I/O ports. Imports no `node:`/`bun:`/`obsidian`. |
| [`@docket/cli`](packages/cli)                         | The standalone CLI: Node/Bun port adapters, config + `.env` loading, compiled to one binary.                                   |
| [`@docket/obsidian-plugin`](packages/obsidian-plugin) | The Obsidian plugin: adapters, settings tab, control-center panel, indent rendering.                                           |

## Prerequisites

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.x** to build either front end. The compiled CLI
  binary then runs standalone (Bun embeds its own runtime); Bun stays required
  only if you run the CLI from source.
- An **Atlassian API token** for the account you sync with. Create one at
  <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens>.
- For the plugin: **Obsidian 1.5.0+**, desktop (the plugin is desktop-only).

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctx42/docket
cd docket
bun install
```

### CLI

The bundled `scripts/install.sh` builds the CLI and installs it as a single
binary. It runs the same from any directory. The install directory mirrors Go's
`GOBIN`: `$TSBIN` when set, otherwise `~/bin`. The command name is `$TSBIN_NAME`
when set, otherwise `docket`:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh                        # -> ~/bin/docket
TSBIN=/usr/local/bin ./scripts/install.sh   # -> /usr/local/bin/docket
```

It warns if the destination isn't on your `PATH`, or if another command of the
same name already resolves elsewhere. Then verify:

```sh
docket version
```

Prefer to build by hand? The script just wraps this:

```sh
bun run --filter '@docket/cli' build
./packages/cli/dist/docket version
```

This compiles a self-contained binary at `packages/cli/dist/docket`; symlink or
copy it onto your `PATH` wherever you keep your own executables.

> [!NOTE]
> To run the CLI from source (so it picks up edits without a rebuild), point a
> wrapper at the entry point instead: `bun packages/cli/src/index.ts <args>`.
> Bun must stay installed for that form.

### Obsidian plugin

Install it from the Obsidian community-plugin store — no build required:

1. **Settings → Community plugins**, and turn off Restricted mode if it's on.
2. **Browse**, search for **docket**, and click **Install**.
3. **Enable** the plugin.

Then jump to [In Obsidian](#in-obsidian) to connect and start syncing.

> [!NOTE]
> Building from source instead? Compile the bundle and copy its three shipping
> files into your vault:
>
> ```sh
> bun run --filter '@docket/obsidian-plugin' build
> mkdir -p /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/ctx42-docket
> cp packages/obsidian-plugin/dist/{main.js,manifest.json,styles.css} \
>    /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/ctx42-docket/
> ```
>
> The repo also has a helper that builds and deploys into a vault in one step
> (and can symlink for a hot-reload dev loop):
>
> ```sh
> bun run deploy:plugin /path/to/vault          # build + copy
> bun run deploy:plugin /path/to/vault --link   # build + symlink (dev)
> ```

## Quickstart

### With the CLI

Two files sit side by side: a committable config that says *what* to sync, and
a git-ignored `.env` that holds the secrets. Create `.docket.yaml`:

```yaml
# .docket.yaml — what to sync (no secrets here)
timeout: 30s
pages:
  notes/onboarding.md: /wiki/spaces/TEAM/pages/12345/Onboarding
folders:
  glossary: /wiki/spaces/TEAM/folder/67890
spaces:
  team-wiki: /wiki/spaces/TEAM
```

and `.env` beside it:

```sh
# .env — secrets and the sync root (never commit this)
DOCKET_SITE=your-site
DOCKET_ACCOUNT=you@example.com
DOCKET_TOKEN=your-api-token
DOCKET_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/your/vault
```

`DOCKET_SITE` is just the subdomain — the part before `.atlassian.net` (for
`https://your-site.atlassian.net`, it is `your-site`). Then:

```sh
docket test                     # verify authenticated access to the Site
docket pull                     # pull everything configured, to Markdown
docket pull notes/onboarding.md # or re-pull one managed page
```

Each configured page — and every page inside a configured folder or space — is
rendered to its `.md` file under the sync root, its images downloaded to
`_assets/`, and the source ADF cached under `.adf_cache/`. Edit the `.md` files
in any editor, then push:

```sh
docket push                     # push every edited page
docket push notes/onboarding.md # or push one page
```

An unchanged page is skipped. If the remote page moved since you pulled,
`docket` three-way merges your edits onto the new version and refuses only when
the same block changed on both sides — re-pull and reapply in that case.

To create a page, add a new `.md` file under a folder or space root with a
title but no `docket_page_id`, then push. `docket` lists each new note with a
choice — **ask later** (the default), **create**, or **never push** (writes
`docket_mode: ignore-push` to its frontmatter) — then creates the ones marked
create under the parent derived from the directory. A created page, and any
folder `docket` creates above it, sets no restrictions of its own, so it
inherits who can see it from its folder or space:

```sh
docket push               # pick create / ask later / never push per new note
docket push --yes         # create every new note without the list
```

### In Obsidian

1. Open **Settings → docket** and fill in the **Connection** section: your site
   subdomain, account email, and API token. Click **Test** to confirm access.
   The token is stored on this device only, never in the shareable settings.
2. Under **Sync map**, add the pages, folders, and spaces to sync — each row
   maps a vault path to a Confluence link. Already have a `.docket.yaml`?
   **Import** it (credentials are never included; **Export** writes one back).
3. Open the **control center** from the ribbon (the up/down-arrow icon) or the
   command palette. It gives you four actions:

   | Action                  | What it does                                   |
   |-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | **Pull → Whole vault**  | Pull every configured page into the vault.     |
   | **Pull → Current note** | Re-pull just the note you're viewing.          |
   | **Push → Whole vault**  | Push all edited notes (shows a preview first). |
   | **Push → Current note** | Push just the current note.                    |

A push always opens a **review screen** first: one selectable row per
candidate, flagging new pages and any whose remote version moved since you
pulled, so you commit only what you mean to. Progress and a per-note result log
stream live in the panel. The same actions are available as commands (search
"docket" in the palette) for hotkey binding.

## CLI commands

```text
docket <command> [flags] [page]

test            Verify authenticated access to the Atlassian Site.
pull [page]     Pull configured pages, folders, and spaces into the cache.
                Reports each note as added, updated, unchanged, or conflict,
                and removes notes whose Confluence page no longer exists (a
                note with unpushed edits is kept, with a warning). With a page
                path, pull only that one managed page.
push [page]     Push edited Markdown back to Confluence, creating confirmed
                new pages. With a page path, push only that page.
status          List managed pages whose Confluence version has moved ahead
                of your local copy (the pages a pull would update). One bulk
                request, so it is cheap even for a whole space.
gc              List orphaned files in the shared _assets directory. Add
                --prune to delete them.
clean           Remove local files under configured folder and space roots
                that no longer exist in Confluence, including notes with
                unpushed edits that a pull keeps back. Prompts unless --yes.
version         Print the program version and exit.
help [command]  Print help, or help for a command.
```

Every config-reading command accepts these flags after the command name; run
`docket help <command>` for a command's own flags:

```text
--config <path>     Configuration file path (default ./.docket.yaml).
--env <path>        Path to the .env file (default ./.env). An exported value
                    wins over it.
--sync-root <path>  Folder pages sync under; overrides DOCKET_ROOT.
--yes               Skip confirmation prompts (push, clean).
--force             Repush pages whose ADF changed even if the Markdown did
                    not (push).
--drop-comments     Detach open inline comments whose highlighted text an
                    edit rewrote, instead of moving them (push).
--prune             Delete the orphaned asset files (gc).
-h, --help          Print the command's help and exit.
```

The exit code is `0` on success and `1` on any failure; a partial run (some
pages failed) prints the per-page log and exits `1`.

## Configuration

The Site credentials and the sync root come from the environment (or a `.env`
file), never from the config file — setting any of them in `.docket.yaml` is an
error. A value already exported in the environment wins over `.env`.

| Setting   | Source                             | Required | Description                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| site      | `DOCKET_SITE`                      | yes      | Site subdomain, e.g. `your-site`.                 |
| account   | `DOCKET_ACCOUNT`                   | yes      | Atlassian account email; the Basic-auth username. |
| token     | `DOCKET_TOKEN`                     | yes      | Atlassian API token; the Basic-auth password.     |
| sync root | `--sync-root` / `DOCKET_ROOT`      | yes      | Folder every mapped destination resolves under¹.  |

¹ A relative sync root is resolved against the directory of the config file;
`--sync-root` wins over `DOCKET_ROOT`.

The config file (YAML) holds only what to sync:

| Key               | Required | Description                                                     |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timeout`         | no       | Per-request HTTP timeout, e.g. `45s` (default `30s`).           |
| `markdown.margin` | no       | Hard-wrap column for Markdown text; `0`/unset = no wrap.        |
| `comments`        | no       | Pull comments as `[!comment]` callouts; push resolves (off).    |
| `pages`           | no²      | Map of destination `.md` under the sync root → Confluence path. |
| `folders`         | no²      | Map of destination dir under the sync root → Confluence folder. |
| `spaces`          | no²      | Map of destination dir under the sync root → Confluence space.  |

² `pages`, `folders`, and `spaces` are each optional, but configure at least
one — a config with none has nothing to sync. No single page may be claimed by
more than one entry.

Under the sync root, `docket` manages three reserved locations:

| Location      | Contents                                                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_assets/`    | Downloaded images, shared across pages; embedded as `![[name]]`.      |
| `.adf_cache/` | The cached source ADF (`.vN.json`) and the link index (`links.json`). |
| `_index.md`   | A directory's own page, when a folder or space page has children.     |

### What `docket` ignores

Not every file under a mapped root is synced. `docket` skips:

- **Non-`.md` files** — only Markdown notes are considered; anything else is
  left alone.
- **The `.adf_cache/` directory** — its cached `.md` copies are sync artifacts,
  never your notes, so the maintenance commands (`push`, `gc`, `clean`) never
  walk into it.
- **Notes that aren't managed pages** — a `.md` file with no frontmatter, or
  whose frontmatter has neither a `docket_page_id` nor a `title`, is not a page
  `docket` owns and is skipped by `push`.
- **Locally-created notes not yet pushed** — a note marked
  `docket_local: true` is excluded everywhere until you create it.
- **Notes you explicitly hold back** — add `docket_mode: ignore-push` to a
  note's frontmatter and `push` leaves it out entirely: it is never created,
  updated, or reported by `status` as having moved. Use it to keep an
  in-progress or intentionally-local edit out of Confluence without moving or
  renaming the file. (The marker shares the `docket_mode` key with the
  managed-note `pull` value, so re-pulling the page rewrites it back to `pull`;
  re-add `ignore-push` after a pull if you still want it held back.)

> [!TIP]
> The Obsidian plugin reads and writes the **same `.docket.yaml` sync map** —
> Import one you already have, or Export the map you built in settings to share
> it with CLI users. Credentials are never part of it.

The plugin keeps the equivalent settings in its **Settings → docket** tab: the
connection fields and Markdown options (flavor, wrap margin, request timeout,
and a vault-relative sync-root subfolder), plus the same page/folder/space
maps. The API token is stored per-device, outside the vault; everything else
lives in the vault's shareable plugin data (`data.json`).

### Inside an Obsidian vault

Run from inside a vault that has the docket plugin, the CLI needs no
`.docket.yaml` or `.env`: it uses the plugin's configuration, so the two can
never drift apart, and it shares the plugin's cache, so a note pulled in
Obsidian can be pushed from the terminal and the other way round.

- **Detection** — the CLI walks up from the working directory; the first folder
  holding `.obsidian/plugins/ctx42-docket/data.json` is the vault. Every run there
  prints `config: vault <path> (docket plugin, schema vN)` on stderr. A vault
  whose Obsidian config folder is renamed (not `.obsidian`) is not detected, and
  the CLI falls back to `.docket.yaml`.
- **One source of config** — inside a vault, `--config`, `--env`, `--sync-root`,
  and a `.docket.yaml` in the working directory are errors. `DOCKET_*`
  variables and a default `.env` are ignored, with a warning naming them. The
  sync root is the plugin's sync-root subfolder (or the vault), whichever
  folder you run from.
- **Cache and token** — the plugin keeps its ADF cache, link index, and API
  token outside the vault, in the per-user cache directory, and records where in
  a per-device file under `.obsidian/plugins/ctx42-docket/devices/`. If that file is
  missing or was written on another device, the CLI refuses to run: open the
  vault in Obsidian on this device once, with the plugin enabled.
- **One run at a time** — the CLI and the plugin take a lock in the shared cache
  for every operation. While one runs, the other refuses and names it (`busy:
  docket CLI pull, pid 4242`); the plugin's panel keeps its last result,
  marked stale. A lock left by a crashed process is cleared automatically.
- **Versions** — the plugin's `data.json` carries a schema version. A CLI older
  than the plugin that wrote it refuses to run and asks to be upgraded.

Exporting a `.docket.yaml` into the vault from the plugin asks for confirmation
first, since the CLI then refuses to run from that folder.

## Markdown dialect

`docket` reads and writes an **Obsidian-native** Markdown dialect, so a pulled
page is a first-class Obsidian note. Standard Markdown carries the obvious
things — headings, paragraphs, **bold**/*italic*/~~strikethrough~~/`code`,
links, bullet and numbered lists, fenced code blocks, and GFM tables.
Everything Confluence adds on top round-trips through the small set of
extensions below.

### Inline extensions

- **Images** are Obsidian embeds — `![[onboarding-diagram.png]]` — resolved
  against `_assets/`, not `![alt](path)` links. An externally-hosted image
  stays a plain `![alt](url)`.
- **Underlined and colored text**, which Markdown has no syntax for, use inline
  HTML: `<u>…</u>` for underline and `<span style="color:red">…</span>` for a
  text color.
- **Smart links** (Confluence inline cards) render as bare autolinks —
  `<https://example.com>` — kept distinct from a normal `[label](url)` link so
  they round-trip as cards.
- **Confluence-only inline nodes** round-trip as `` `adf:…` `` code spans, keyed
  by a leading sigil, so they survive an edit untouched and never render as
  broken Markdown:
  - status lozenge — `` `adf:!In progress|color=blue` ``
  - date — `` `adf:#2026-07-19|ts=1768…` ``
  - emoji — `` `adf::smile` ``
  - mention — `` `adf:@Jane Doe` `` (an id is appended when the name is
    ambiguous on the page)
  - any other inline macro — `` `adf:*inlineExtension:…` ``
- **Unsupported inline nodes** freeze as an invisible `%%adf:…%%` comment:
  read-only and preserved verbatim.

### Block extensions

- **Panels** map to GitHub-style alerts — `> [!INFO]`, `> [!WARNING]`, … — the
  uppercased panel type as the tag, with the body quoted below it. A plain
  blockquote (no tag) stays a bare `> ` quote.
- **Expand** blocks become a `> [!EXPAND] Title` alert; the title after the tag
  stays editable.
- **Indented paragraphs** carry their nesting depth as an `N> ` marker on the
  first line — `1> `, `2> `, … The Obsidian plugin renders the marker as a
  visually indented paragraph in both Live Preview and Reading view; without
  the plugin the literal `N> ` marker is shown.
- **Multi-line table cells** join their lines with `<br>`.
- **Blocks Markdown can't express** (macros, an `EXPAND`-type panel, unusual
  tables) are frozen in fenced ` ```adf ` blocks with a YAML body: read-only,
  preserved verbatim, and refused rather than corrupted if you edit inside them.

### Comments

Opt in with `comments: true` in the config (or the plugin's **Comments** toggle);
it is off by default. A pull then brings each page's Confluence comments in
alongside the body:

- An **inline comment** appends a `[^cf-<id>]` footnote anchor after the run of
  text it annotates, and a `> [!comment]` callout after that block. The callout's
  first line carries the thread's id, author, date, and resolution; replies nest
  as deeper callouts.
- **Footer comments** (page-level) collect in a trailing `## Comments` section.
- The pull mirrors what Confluence shows on the page, so it **omits** two kinds of
  comment Confluence itself hides: **resolved** inline comments (once a thread is
  resolved it drops out entirely — reopening it in the UI brings it back on the
  next pull), and **dangling** inline comments — ones whose highlighted text was
  deleted, so the anchor no longer exists in the body.

Comments are **managed on Confluence**, with one exception: a push can
**resolve** an inline comment. A push **strips** the callouts and `[^cf-…]`
anchors before reconstructing the body, so it never sends a reply, an edit, or a
new comment — do those in the Confluence UI.

- **Resolve** an inline comment by removing **both** its `[!comment]` callout and
  its `[^cf-…]` anchor from the note, then pushing. Deleting the whole commented
  paragraph together with its callout counts. A note whose only change is a
  resolve pushes no page update and no new version. The push report (and the
  plugin's push review) lists each resolve by id and highlighted text.
- Removing **only one** of the two — the callout but not the anchor, or the
  anchor but not the callout — **fails the push** before anything is sent:
  remove both to resolve, or restore the removed part to keep the comment.
- If the thread **changed on Confluence** since your last pull — a new reply, or
  an edited comment — the push fails and asks you to **pull first**, so a reply
  you have not seen is never resolved away. A thread already resolved or deleted
  on Confluence is skipped and reported as already done.
- **Footer comments** and **replies** are never changed by a push: removing or
  editing their callouts is ignored, and the next pull restores them.
- A resolve that fails after the page update succeeded is a warning — the pushed
  page stands, the comment's callout comes back, and removing it again retries.
- After a push the note is re-rendered with the comments still open.

What a push *also* guarantees is that it never detaches an existing comment: a
Confluence inline comment is an anchor mark the platform owns and the body
can't otherwise express, so before each update the push re-grafts the live
page's comment anchors onto the body. A comment survives as long as the text it
highlights still exists — anywhere it now occurs, the closest to its original
spot wins — or survives lightly edited: a change of case, or a near-match within
its own paragraph (a word changed, not a rewrite). When an edit rewrites the
highlighted words beyond that (keeping the anchor), the push **moves** each open
comment onto the nearest remaining text — its own paragraph when that still
exists, else the closest surviving one — and names it in a warning; push with
`--drop-comments` to detach them deliberately instead. Edit prose freely — just
don't hand-edit the `[!comment]` metadata lines or the `[^cf-…]` anchors, which
are `docket`-managed. Comments are not versioned with the page, so every pull
re-fetches them; a note left comment-free by an earlier pull picks them up on
the next one.

You freely edit prose, headings, list items, blockquotes, panels, expands, and
table cells, and add paragraphs and images; the frozen ` ```adf ` blocks and
`%%adf:…%%` comments carry everything else through unchanged, and an
`` `adf:…` `` span is safe to move but not to hand-edit. Frontmatter — the
`docket_mode: pull` marker that flags the note as `docket`-managed, plus the
bookkeeping fields that track each note's Confluence page — must be left
intact. Every key `docket` keeps for itself carries the `docket_` prefix, so it
never collides with a key another tool reads:

| Key                   | Holds                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `docket_mode`         | `pull` (managed) or `ignore-push` (held back)        |
| `docket_local`        | `true` on a page created locally, not yet pushed     |
| `docket_page_path`    | The note's path under the sync root                  |
| `docket_page_id`      | The Confluence page ID                               |
| `docket_page_version` | The page version the note is based on                |
| `docket_space_id`     | The ID of the page's space                           |
| `docket_parent_id`    | The parent page ID; absent on a space homepage       |
| `docket_space_key`    | The space key; only on a page pulled through a space |
| `docket_domain`       | The Site host the page was pulled from               |
| `docket_page_images`  | The page's images: local ID, file, and alt text      |
| `docket_mentions`     | Mention display names mapped to account IDs          |

The remaining keys are shared with other Markdown tools and stay unprefixed.
`title` is the page title. `id`, right after the marker, is the Confluence page
ID as a quoted string, the same value as `docket_page_id`, so it stays the same
when the page is moved or renamed upstream and a Markdown indexer can key the
note on it. `url` is the page's Confluence URL, so a Markdown indexer can cite
the page without knowing Confluence. Every pull and push rewrites them. Section
anchors are not written: `docket` keeps no per-heading key in the note, and a
pull or push drops the `heading_anchors` list earlier versions wrote.

Notes written before the `docket_` prefix carry the old unprefixed keys
(`docket-plugin`, `cf_local`, `page_id`, `page_version`, `page_path`,
`space_id`, `parent_id`, `space_key`, `cf_domain`, `page_images`, `mentions`).
`docket` still reads them — an old `docket-plugin: ignore-push` still holds a
note back, and an old `cf_local` still marks it local — but writes only the
prefixed keys, so the next pull of a note, or a push that updates it, rewrites
its frontmatter to the new names. Rename a hand-written `docket-plugin:` or
`cf_local:` marker yourself; a pull does not touch a note it does not manage.

## Development

The workspace is driven with Bun. From the repository root:

```sh
bun run typecheck      # tsc -b across all packages
bun run lint           # biome
bun run test           # vitest (the whole suite is hermetic — no network)
bun run build          # build the plugin bundle and the CLI binary
bun run check          # typecheck + lint + test
```

The core is runtime-neutral by contract: it imports nothing from `node:`,
`bun:`, or `obsidian`, and a boundary test fails the suite on any leak. All I/O
— HTTP, filesystem, clock, environment, streams — is injected through ports, so
the same orchestration runs under the CLI's Node adapters, the plugin's
Obsidian adapters, and the tests' in-memory fakes.

## Status

Both front ends cover the full pull / edit / push / create / gc / clean cycle
against a real Confluence Site. The **CLI** ships as a single self-contained
binary; the **Obsidian plugin** is available in the community-plugin store and
drives the same cycle — connect, map, and pull/push from the control center.
