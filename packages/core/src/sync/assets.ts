// Image-asset download, ported from the download half of `pkg/docket/assets.go`.
// A pull resolves every file-media reference in a page against the page's
// attachments and downloads each into the shared assets directory (under the sync
// root, so Obsidian `![[…]]` embeds resolve), returning a map from each media node
// localId to the image path relative to the note. Everything goes through the
// injected {@link ConfluenceClient} and {@link FileSystem} ports. Upload/canonical
// naming (`canonicalAssetName`) is the push side, M7.3.

/**
 * assetsFromDisk reconstructs the {@link downloadImages} assets map — media node
 * localId → image path relative to `dest` — from the files already in
 * `assetsDir`, without any network I/O. A pull uses it on a version/cache hit
 * (the page body was served from the ADF cache, so its images were downloaded by
 * an earlier pull and are already on disk), skipping the attachment round-trip.
 *
 * It matches each ref to a file named `{fileId}-{localId}{ext}` — the name
 * {@link assetName} writes — by prefix, since the extension is derived from the
 * attachment's media type, which is not known here. It returns null (signalling
 * the caller to fall back to {@link downloadImages}) if ANY referenced image is
 * absent: a ref never resolved to an attachment, or a prior pull was interrupted
 * after the ADF was cached but before its images were downloaded. Returning the
 * whole map or nothing keeps the fallback all-or-nothing, so a partial map never
 * renders a page with some images missing.
