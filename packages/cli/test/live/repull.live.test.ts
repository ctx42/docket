// Live re-pull (merge-path) round-trips against the real Site. A re-pull writes
// an EXISTING note through Puller.mergeIntoNote, which reconciles three states:
// the note on disk (local), the cached render of the note's recorded version
// (base), and the freshly rendered remote. store() renders, merges into the
// note, then refreshes the cached render — in that order, because the merge
// base IS the cached .vN.md and refreshing it first would overwrite the base
// with the new content, so an unchanged-version re-render at the same version
// would be seen as "remote unchanged" and dropped (the comments-toggle bug).
// These tests drive that path end to end: an idempotent re-pull, a preserved
// local edit, and a render that changes at the same version (margin toggled on
// the second pull) that must re-render the note rather than drop it. The
// two-pull pattern seeds a page, pulls, rewrites the config, and pulls again,
// asserting on the pulled note's on-disk contents.
// Run: bun run --filter @docket/cli test:live
