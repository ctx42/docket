# path. The install directory mirrors Go's GOBIN: it is $TSBIN when set, else
# ~/bin. The installed command name is $TSBIN_NAME when set, else "docket". So:
#
#   ./scripts/install.sh                        # -> ~/bin/docket
#   TSBIN=/usr/local/bin ./scripts/install.sh   # -> /usr/local/bin/docket
#   TSBIN_NAME=cf ./scripts/install.sh          # -> ~/bin/cf
#
# Bun is required to build; the compiled binary then runs standalone.
