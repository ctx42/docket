// Comment decoration for the ADF→Markdown render. A Confluence inline comment is
// an `annotation` mark on a run of body text; its thread content lives outside
// the body ADF (fetched separately) and is threaded in through
// {@link MdCtx.comments}. This module draws each thread as a GitHub-style
// `[!comment]` callout: an inline comment's callout is appended after the
// top-level block that carries its marker (the annotated run also gets a
// `[^cf-<markerRef>]` ref, emitted by the inline renderer), and footer comments
// plus any inline thread whose marker was not found in the body collect into a
// trailing `## Comments` section. The decorations are stripped before a push
// reconstruct, so they never reach Confluence (Stage 1 is read-only).

 * top-level `[!comment]` callout block, including the trailing `## Comments`
 * heading and the footer callouts under it; a `## Comments` heading anywhere
