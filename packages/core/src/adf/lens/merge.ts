// The block-level three-way merge, ported from `pkg/adf/merge.go`. When a push
// carries a stale baseline (the remote has moved since the local Markdown was
// pulled), merge3 rebases the local edits onto the remote so non-overlapping
// edits combine and only a block edited on both sides is a conflict. It works on
// the rendered block texts — dialect-stable, so it ports 1:1 — and never mutates
// a document; the merged body is still gated by the lens laws when Put against
// the remote.
