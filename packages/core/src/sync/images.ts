// Image upload, ported from the upload half of `pkg/docket/images.go`. On push,
// every user-added local image embedded on its own line (`![[file]]`) is uploaded
// as a new attachment so the lens can splice it in as a media node; each is
// recorded in the assets map (localId → path) for the refreshed frontmatter and,
// on failure, cleaned up so a rejected push leaves no orphan attachment. An image
// embedded inline in a paragraph cannot be uploaded (the lens cannot anchor an
// inline media node), so the push rejects it. Detection is re-baselined from Go's
// `![alt](path)` to the Obsidian `![[file]]` embed dialect; a resolved image is a
// bare-name embed next to the note.
